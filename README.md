# PetroFeed Workflow

An easy to follow and lightweight process for developing features in a startup environment.

## The Process

1. Choose & Challenge.
2. Understand.
3. Create.
4. Deploy.
5. Review.

## Step by step description

### 1. CHOOSE & CHALLENGE.

- Decide what the feature to be added to the product is.
- Verify that there is value from this feature for the people who will be using it. (Challenge its reason to exist).
- Verify that <strong>now</strong> is the proper time to implement this feature. (Challenge its reason to exist at this very moment.)

### 2. UNDERSTAND.

To get everyone on the same page, have the team collaboratively produce the following items:

- Rough sketch of the feature's full interface.
- High level technical requirements.
- Estimated deadline. (This could be one sprint if your team is using Agile Methodology.)
- The measureables for this feature: How does your team expect people to interact with this feature? Set a goal: E.g: 10% of users will click button X and of those 2% will buy the upgrade. Put analytics in place to measure your feature's performance.

Post these items somewhere for the team to see easily. Don't bury them in some obscure spot in your software. We post these items in our GitHub Pull Requests.

### 3. CREATE.

Understand how this feature fits into your product's technology architecture. Don't just hack it in, decide on the best way for this new logic to fit into your product gracefully. Ensure to build in a way to track progress against your measurables from step 2.

Ensure that you don't skip over the creation of engagement material for this feature: Email / social media campaign, website update, blog post, etc.

Now build the feature using whatever strategies your team likes best.

As you build the feature, write down the major challenges your team faced, what you would have done differently, etc.

### 4. DEPLOY.

Launch the feature into production. This should be quick and easy. The feature should be fully tested before being deployed.

Write a (very) small post-mortem report containing everything you've tracked for this feature from steps 1 through 3.

### 5. REVIEW.

After 2 weeks, measure the feature's performance:

- How did it hold up against the company's quality standards?
- How did it's usage compare against your goals set in step 2?
- Did it seem to provide worthwile value to people using your product?
- What other things are worth noting about this feature?

Update your post-mortem report with the answers to the above questions.

Present about this feature to a group of people outside of your team.
